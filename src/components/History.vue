    <p class="px-8 pb-3">
      In 1973, residents of the Rossville community started discussions leading
      to the organization of the Volunteer Ambulance Service.  The service
      began January 7, 1974. V.A.S. was one of the first volunteer ambulance 
      services certified by the Indiana Emergency Medical Services Commission. 
      Residents from Ross and Owen Townships of Clinton County, plus adjoining areas, 
      became actively involved with V.A.S. by contributing their time as EMT’s (Emergency
      Medical Technicians) and by constructing the headquarters building. The
      community also made generous financial contributions toward the
      construction of the new building and towards the purchase of a new
      ambulance. Leo Brown of Brown Funeral Home also donated an ambulance.

      Eighty-four EMT’s were trained in the first two EMT classes held in
      Rossville in 1974. Over 200 EMT’s have received their training in the
      V.A.S sponsored EMT certification classes.  Today there are only about 5
      EMT's serving.

      V.A.S. strives to serve the Rossville community 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
      We encourage you to contact any EMT to learn how you to can help provide
      emergency care for your friends, family, and neighbors. Anyone wishing to
      learn more on how to be a part of the V.A.S., can contact our business
      number at 765-379-2998 and leave a message. We need help very
      badly. Our goal is to try and have the best up to date equipment and to
      have a response time of less than 10 minutes to all parts of our response
      area at all times.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-10 px-8">
      At the present time the V.A.S. has one ambulance for calls at all times.
      We staff the ambulance with volunteer crews of dedicated men and women 
      who carry pagers/radios to alert them to a call. They respond from their 
      homes or places of business to the V.A.S. headquarters building to get 
      the ambulance and respond to the call. The V.A.S. current roster only has 
      about 15 active volunteers. Volunteers are urgently needed.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-10 px-8">
      Since 1973 the Rossville Volunteer Ambulance Service has been a very
      valuable part of the Rossville community. Your participation is highly
      encouraged!
